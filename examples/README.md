# Examples

### Build

#### Native:

Build and run an example, in this case the `triangle` example:

```console
$ cargo run --release --example triangle
```

#### WebAssembly:

See `web/README.md`.

### A note on async

All of the examples builds to both native (desktop, mobile or whatever target specified) and WebAssembly (wasm) that can be run in a browser.
Because they should run in a browser and to keep the same code for native and wasm, all loading happens async.
If your application is native only, you can avoid the async runtime (`tokio` or `async-std`) and use `three_d_asset::load` instead of `three_d_asset::load_async`.

## Triangle [[code](https://github.com/asny/three-d/tree/master/examples/triangle/src/main.rs)] [[demo](https://asny.github.io/three-d/0.19/triangle.html)]

This is the recommended starting point for a gentle introduction to `three-d`.

## Triangle core [[code](https://github.com/asny/three-d/tree/master/examples/triangle_core/src/main.rs)] [[demo](https://asny.github.io/three-d/0.19/triangle_core.html)]

This is the same as the `Triangle` example, except it only uses the core module and not the renderer module.

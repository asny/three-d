# Examples

### Build

#### Native:

Build and run an example, in this case 'triangle':

```console
$ cargo run --example triangle --release
```

#### WebAssembly:

Prerequisites: 
- A server that properly defines the `application/wasm` mime type (for example [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)

Build and generate web output (webassembly, javascript and html files) into the pkg folder:

```console
$ wasm-pack build examples/triangle --target web --out-name web --out-dir ../../pkg
```

Start the server and go to http://localhost:8080 in a browser:

```console
$ http-server
```

### A note on async

All of the examples builds to both native (desktop, mobile or whatever target specified) and WebAssembly (wasm) that can be run in a browser. 
Because they should run in a browser and to keep the same code for native and wasm, all loading happens async. 
If your application is native only, you can avoid the async runtime (`tokio` or `async-std`) and use `Loader::load_blocking` instead of `Loader::load_async`.

## Headless [[code](https://github.com/asny/three-d/tree/master/examples/headless/src/main.rs)]

This example does not create a window but render directly to a render target and saves the result to disk. Therefore, this example does not work on web.
